# C++ -OOP
In this project, we siumulate the process of the operation of a School. We simulate the entrance of the students and teachers in the school, their process of going in the class by firstly entering the school, then through the yard, climbing the stairs, entering the floor, walking the corridor and ariving to the class. 


After everyone enetered the school, we simulate the operation of the School, by assigining how tired each student and teacher are. he tireness is defined by the number of hours of operation of the school multiplied by the tireness value of each person(depending if it is a teacher,  senior student(class 4-6) or a junior (class 1-3)). After that everyone exits the school and we destroy it.

The school has 1 building and 1 yard. Each building has 1 stairs and 3 floors. Each floor has 1 corridor and 6 classes(1-6). 

Each class has a maximum capacity of 25 students and 1 teacher. 

We use inheritance to not copy the same code all the time.
